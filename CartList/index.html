      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 2026</p>
      <p>
        Thank you for using <strong>CartList</strong>. Your privacy is important
        to us, and we are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy
        explains what information our app collects, how it is used, and your
        rights regarding that information.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        <strong
          >CartList does not collect, transmit, or store any personally
          identifiable information on our servers.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The information you create inside the app (such as lists and items) is
        stored locally on your device only.
      </p>

      <h3>Device Storage</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Your shopping lists and items are stored locally using on-device
          storage technology.
        </li>
        <li>Nothing is uploaded to external servers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. No Third-Party Services</h2>

        The app does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising
        networks, social platforms, or cloud services.

      <h2>3. Permissions Used</h2>
      <p>
        CartList does <strong>not</strong> request or require access to any
        system permissions on your device.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any actions such as sharing your lists occur through system-level share
        sheets without requiring direct permission access from the app.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Your Data</h2>
      <p>
        All data you create remains on your device until you delete the app or
        its stored content. We do not have access to your data, nor can we
        restore it if you uninstall the app.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>

        CartList is safe for all ages and does not knowingly collect any
        personal information from children or adults.
      </p>
